            <h1>HYDROPONICS <br>  </h1>
            <p> Within a <span>Hydroponic system</span>, roots of a plant are suspended in either a static, continuously aerated nutrient solution, or within a continuous flow or mist of nutrient solution. This <span>pH</span>  adjusted nutrient solution is comprised of 16 of the 19 required elements for survival, some of which include carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, potassium, iron, and copper2.
                A crucial aspect of plant growth is the process of <span>Photosynthesis</span>, in which plants, as well as other organisms such as algae and certain bacteria, convert light energy into the chemical energy required for growth. Within a hydroponics system, this light energy is typically provided by an <span>artificial lighting source</span> , such as a lamp, combined with a shade or reflector used to direct light towards the plant.
